/* Scope
1. Window scope
2. Local scope
3. Global scope
 */

// var - function scoped
// let - block scoped

/*
So, one should always use let and const as of best practices.
let     - is used for any value which change.
const   - for any constant value(and for array, object, arrow function and function expression)*/
